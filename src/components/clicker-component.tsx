/**
 * General state, state management
 * Communication and updating of state, between parent and child components
 *
 * (Stateful) components will have values attached to their state.
 * This state value can be accessed via this.state.key.
 *
 * When we initialize the component, for instance, using the constructor,
 * we can assign an initial state. Afterwords, we should never directly mutate
 * the state. State is immutable. Instead, we pass a new state to the setState
 * function, to move from one immutable state to the next.
 *
 * The reason for this is that if we mutate the state directly React will not
 * know that the state has changed, and therefore cannot know to rerender content.
